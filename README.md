# Student Data Management System

This project is a simple Student Data Management System implemented in Python 3. It allows users to enter and store student information such as Name, Roll Number, Department, CGPA, and Field of Interest. The program provides a menu-driven interface where users can choose options to display the stored data, add new student data, or remove existing data.

## Features

- **Display Student Data**: Users can choose this option to view the stored student data. The program will display the Name, Roll Number, Department, CGPA, and Field of Interest of each student.

- **Add Student Data**: Users can enter the details of a new student, including their Name, Roll Number, Department, CGPA, and Field of Interest. The program will store this information for future reference.

- **Remove Student Data**: Users can remove a student's data by providing their Roll Number. If the Roll Number exists in the database, the program will remove the corresponding student's information.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the project files to your local machine.

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system.

1. Run the `student_data_management.py` file using the following command:

   ```
   python3 Project.py
   ```


1. You will be presented with a menu where you can choose different options by entering the corresponding numbers.

1. Follow the on-screen prompts to perform the desired actions, such as displaying student data, adding a new student, or removing existing student data.

1. Continue using the menu options until you are ready to quit the program.
